      <description>Principle of &amp;lsquo;suboptimization&amp;rsquo; The enhancer consists of low-affinity TF binding sites in a suboptimal syntax, in terms of flanking nucleotides and spacing between the sites. Optimizing the TF binding affinities can lead to ectopic expression.
Experiment In sea squirt, 15 synthetic enhancers consisting of 2 ETS binding sites and a ZicL binding site. Only 2 show activities. Further manipulation confirm key roles for binding site orientation, spacing and flanking nucleotides.</description>

      <description>In summer 2017 during one of the Xin He lab reading group session we came up with the notion of crowdsourcing the efforts of reading papers. The gist is that we should figure out a way to not only share our literature reading notes, but also engage in discussions / debates if there are multiple people interested in the same paper.
We were excited about the idea. But how do we go about implementing it?</description>
